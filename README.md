Hello, everybody. My name is Steven, I'm a new wannabe hardware/ software engineer & developer, audio programmer, etc. and I'm looking for direction as to where I can go to learn more about becoming a professional audio programmer, etc.

I'm wanting to get into a C++ framework named JUCE: (http://www.juce.com) but can't seem to find too many resources so I thought I would reach out to whomever is out there and see if I can get pointed in the right direction.

I am too wanting to work with other open source hardware and software like the JUCE framework etc. including things like the Arduino family of products and the Raspberry Pi etc. though to be honest I have no clue as to what I am doing with any of this stuff as of yet so please be patient as I am only a beginner. :)

I'm wanting to.. in time, to create a series of virtual instraments and hardwares to manipulate and control said virtual instruments and other softwares like DAW's and stuff like that being I plan to be, or at least would hope to be using the class compliant MIDI standard becuase I, in reality, would like to be working w/ the iOS platform and maybe, in time turn to become cross platform then working with Android, Windows, Mac and Linux but I'm going to start with what I want to, to begin with, and that is the iOS platform. :P so in-turn I know I'm going to at least need to learn C, C++ and Objective-C to start with and maybe someday some other languages too but I'm not super sure as of yet. So please check my out channel or subscribe for updates. This I hope will be a fun ride.

Sooo... I don't know a lot about computer science or programming other than what I've learned though and on YouTube etc. so I know I've got some work to do but I don't think it'll  be a problem.. I know there are a lot of resources out there on the interwebs so it's just a matter of defining what's necessary or to be pointed into the right direction for what it is I need to do.

If anyone would be willing to help, please don't hastate. lol.

I only JUST setup a Patreon so please don't mind it being so bare.. I'm going to be working on all this stuff as I can.

Same thing with my website, it's only just been put up and played around w/ a little bit but I'm hoping to do something cool with it in time but I really don't know too much of what I'm doing. It's only a WordPress site but it's what I can do for the moment.

Thank you very much for checking out my video, please comment, rate and subscribe for updates. Thanks! :)
